### üìå Introduction
This project is part of my contribution to the [AI Hackfest 2025](https://ai-hackfest-23772.devpost.com/)  \
The primary contribution is contained in the repository: \
üëâ [ai-hackfest-marketeer](https://github.com/StephanieHhnbrg/ai-hackfest-marketeer).

The project is about mail marketing and tackles the problem of customers having overloaded inboxes, causing newsletters to go unnoticed, reducing their impact.
The goal is to boost sales and increase click-through rates (CTR) by delivering more effective and personalized content.

Therefore an AI-powered Marketing Platform, called Marketeer, was built that leverages A/B testing to optimize email campaigns and ensure they reach their full potential.

This repository hosts the mock e-commerce webstore and its associated Python backend scripts deployed via Google Cloud Run.
Its core purpose is to track user interactions coming from email campaigns and generate analytics for performance evaluation.

### üìà Tracked events
* `email_opened`
* `email_bttn_clicked`
* `purchases_completed`
* `webpage_call`

It also records click-through time (from  opening the webstore until clicking on the purchase button), helping refine future targeting and scheduling.
